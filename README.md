## Quick Overview

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:mehdirezaei5/simplest-react-config.git
cd simplest-react-config
npm start
```

### Get Started Immediately

It will create a directory called `simplest-react-config` inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

```
simplest-react-config
├── .babelrc
├── .gitignore
├── App.js
├── index.html
├── main.js
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── webpack.config.js
```

No configuration or complicated folder structures, just the files you need to build your app.<br>
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```sh
cd simplest-react-config
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.
